# Anything Go's

This repository is a collection of Golang code that I've written and would like
to use almost anywhere, and for that reason I've released it here under the
MIT license. Source code may be undocumented and discorganized. Contributions
are welcome. If any utility becomes popular it will be moved to a new
repository, or the `gottagofast` repository if it's generic enough.
